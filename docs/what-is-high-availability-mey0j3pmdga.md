More so, when it comes to the cloud platforms, it’s the key feature which enables the workloads running on them to be highly available.</p>
<p data-id="2c89c612d6fe7349ab2471df9b0b7518">This lesson is an insight into <em>high availability</em>. It covers all the frequently asked questions about it such as:</p>
<ul data-id="299747aaf8998050bc64671a086ac10c">
<li>What is it?</li>
<li>Why is it so important to businesses?</li>
<li>What is a <em>highly available cluster</em>?</li>
<li>How do cloud platforms ensure high availability of the services running on them?</li>
<li>What is <em>fault tolerance</em> &amp; <em>redundancy</em>? How are they related to high availability?</li>
</ul>
<p data-id="eeef93ec4da6d5ed7342789e645f2989">So, without any further ado.
Let’s get on with it.</p>

<blockquote data-id="5dae92580972f75a6c2190765d3505d6">
<p>High availability also known as <em>HA</em> is the ability of the system to stay online despite having failures at the infrastructural level in real-time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-id="5b857cb8708db8345efcd14ceb0811eb">High availability ensures the uptime of the service much more than the normal time. It improves the reliability of the system, ensures minimum downtime.</p>
<p data-id="1a6366c0307b4a9e44fbef00f5aa58c8">The sole mission of highly available systems is to stay online &amp; stay connected. A very basic example of this is having back-up generators to ensure continuous power supply in case of any power outages.</p>
<p data-id="c0ee90fa8d6f749d93243d311b0777bc">In the industry, HA is often expressed as a percentage. For instance, when the system is <em>99.99999%</em> highly available, it simply means <em>99.99999%</em> of the total hosting time the service will be up. You might often see this in the <em>SLA</em> (Service Level Agreements) of cloud platforms.</p>

<p data-id="e00bc63c9800eedb09c735dff9549f33">It might not impact businesses that much if social applications go down for a bit &amp; then bounce back. However, there are mission-critical systems like aircraft systems, spacecrafts, mining machines, hospital servers, finance stock market systems that just cannot afford to go down at any time. After all, lives depend on it.</p>
<p data-id="bb33efb2d07c36e341670bcbdb456fae">The smooth functioning of the mission-critical systems relies on the continual connectivity with their network/servers. These are the instances when we just cannot do without super highly available infrastructures.</p>
<p data-id="357a88bfc57d35551d91152b501c877b">Besides no service likes to go down, critical or not.</p>
<p data-id="7733f7c992722b66296399a6fa93501a">To meet the high availability requirements systems are designed to be <em>fault-tolerant</em>, their components are made <em>redundant</em>.</p>
<p data-id="0cc66fd3c91aec1ed372ef76d6ae09e9">What is fault-tolerant &amp; redundancy in systems designing? I’ll discuss up next;</p>
