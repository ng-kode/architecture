<div class="PageSummary__TopLeft-sc-19qsvz4-36 fwauBw"><p class="PageSummary__Description-sc-19qsvz4-13 cPWwbw">In this lesson, we will conclude our discussion by having an overview of all the things that we have covered in the course.</p></div><div class="styles__ViewerComponentViewStyled-sc-1xosrua-0 cvzEyH"><div><div><div><div><div class=""><div class=""><div class="markdown-container-div"><div class="markdownViewer Markdown__Viewer-sc-7qtuee-1 zJKNA" role="none"><p data-id="22057c98fd6b984e3628527932848e23">Okay!! Guys… In this course upto this point, we’ve gone through all the layers of a web application. Right from the UI, moving through the backend, caching, database, messaging, data processing, pipelines etc.</p>
<p data-id="0a001e1f8db0a3263e4ce66407ccee5a">We learned about different tiers involved in software architecture. The fundamentals of communication over the web, scalability, high availability, monolith, microservices. We’ve learned how notification systems work, how webhooks work.</p>
<p data-id="3d0729949e4919b506be7b5df4997629">We covered the most frequently asked questions online like which is the best database? Which is the best backend &amp; the front-end programming language? We’ve understood that there is no perfect or the best technology. Every technology has a use case.</p>
<p data-id="192a49b22b48acad21120f879eabfbfc">So, in context to designing web applications we’ve comprehensively covered all the concepts in depth. This pretty much concludes the concepts part of this course.</p>
<p data-id="26cb6b4db705b6f8f65bc3ef943b0f96">I am sure by now you have a solid understanding of the web architecture, the concepts involved. When designing an application from the bare bones you won’t be sitting in the dark anymore, you have an understanding of different tiers in web architecture, you know the difference between a monolith &amp; a microservice, &amp; when to pick which.</p>
<p data-id="ad8978c8629a6f6a5282d496ad9b93c2">You know what technology to pick based on the use case. You know how to do your research.</p>
<p data-id="2be7c5a2e11e7498b5c1975dac31b1ad">In the upcoming lessons, we’ll go through a few of the case studies. I believe you already know everything; the case studies are just about applying the learning, that’s about it.</p>
<p data-id="d34f9ff4c6fdd85b2af9f7274b3ac21b">Lets’ jump right into it.</p>
